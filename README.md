# project-spacial-analytics

## Objective
This project provides visual representations of Copenhagen's urban life, more 
specifically the green areas and school life. This project shows where greenery is located and how it is spread throughout the city with school districts in mind. This could help in identifying spaces and school districts that can benefit from more greenery, as well as for parents to be able to prioritize school districts with more green areas.

## Data
The data in this project consists of green areas in Copenhagen Municipality (a www.opendata.dk) and school districts in the city of Copenhagen (b www.opendata.dk.). The datasets are taken from Open Data DK. 

## How to install and Run the project
1. First you need to clone this repository 
- The dataset can be found in the ```data``` folder and does not need to be loaded separately

2. Run the .Rmd script
**Note**: A user-generated prompt is required to execute the code. You will be asked to provide a name of a school, which will generate the number of green areas in the school's particular district. A possible answer could be: Gerbrandskolen. *You might need to* consult with the dataset to make sure that the name of the school you want to check is written correctly in the dataset.

3. Find the results in the ```out``` folder.
